First I want to say that any help identifying bugs and problems is very helpful, since I can’t recreate every possible instance for a bug in tests by myself.

Directions for Executable file use-
1) Open the FP.jar file
2) Type code, following the syntax from this document, in the editor.
3) Click on the Code tab, then Click Run.
4) Use the directory, or browse for a save location and save the file.
5) The Output text file should be created in the same directory as the executable. Open it and check the results.

The syntax of my language is as follows:

Variable types- integer, decimal, binary, Characters.

Initialisation: 
	
• integer a is 5
• decimal b is 4.2
• binary bool is true
• Characters name is "Vivan"

Assignment: 

• a is a + 1
• b is b * a
• bool is b < a
• name is name + " Shah"

Conditionals: 
Comparators- ( equals / not equals / <  / > / <= / >= )
• If a equals 4
  print( a )
  end if

Loop:

• while a < 4
  print( a )
  a is a + 1
  end loop
• for 5 times
  print ( 5 * 5 )
  end loop 
• from a is 5 to 10
  print(a)
  end loop

Print:

• print( a )
• print( 5 * 7 )
• print( "Hello World!" )

Recent Features:
• Nested Loops/Conditionals
• Implementation of Strings

In the works (In this order):

• Else/else if conditionals
• Error Handling and description
• Order of operations in expressions
• Implementations of Lists
